## Description :clipboard:
<p>
Libft is my own C library with useful functions coded by myself that I will use during my course. This project was about understanding the way these general purpose functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Is a very helpfull librarie since I use it in almost all of my 42 projects.

External functions used: `write()`, `malloc()` and `free()`.

For more information about the project check the [subject here](https://github.com/pedromessetti/libft/blob/master/subject.pdf). The library and functions were written following the rules described in the 42 Norme. To check the Norme [click here](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf).
