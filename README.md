## Description :clipboard:
<p>
Libft is my own C library with useful functions coded by myself that I will use during my course.


Optimized data sorting algorithm. The goal of this project is to sort in ascending order a stack with X amount of random different integers using a limited set of movement operations with the lowest possible count of movements.

All the functions are created by myself except for `write()`, `malloc()` and `free()`. For more information about the project check the subject here. The library and functions were written following the rules described in the 42 Norme. To check the Norme click here.
